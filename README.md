# meteor_d3_example
A simple example of including D3 visualizations in a Meteor app.

The live instance of this app can be found at: http://simple-d3-v1.meteor.com/.
There are two SVG areas: the user clicks on the left area and dots are drawn in both SVGs.
The dots in the left SVG are drawn at the click point, the dots in the right SVG are drawn 
in point with the same y value, but a linear x value (point index * 10).
